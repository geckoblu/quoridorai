<p class="center"><b>Game rules</b></p>

<p>Quoridor is a turn-based game for two players.</p>
<p>At your turn, you may either move your pawn or place a wall, if you have any walls left.</p>
<p>If your pawn reaches the other side of the board before your opponent's does, you win.</p>
<p>If your pawn is adjacent to your opponent's, you may jump over it, either straight or at a right angle.</p>
<p>You are not allowed to place a wall if it would block either player from reaching their goal.</p>

<p class="center"><b>How to use</b></p>

<p>Simply click on the board to move your pawn or place a wall.</p>
